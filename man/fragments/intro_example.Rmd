```{r echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk(
  system.file("examples/example_mail_merge.R", package = "mailmerge")
)
```


Construct a data frame with the content you want to merge into your email:

```{r input-data}
```

Write the text of your email as a R markdown document. You can add the subject line in the yaml header.  Use `{}` braces inside the email to refer to the data inside your data frame.  Expressions inside these braces will be encoded by the `glue::glue_data()` function (See https://glue.tidyverse.org/).

```{r markdown-message}
```

Then you can use `mail_merge()` to embed the content of your data frame into the email message.  By default the email will be shown in a preview window (in the RStudio viewer pane, if you use RStudio).

To send the message, use `send = "draft"` (to save in your gmail drafts folder) or `send = "immediately"` to send the mail immediately.
