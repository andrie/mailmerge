Mail merge from R using markdown documents and gmail.

* Parse markdown documents as the body of email
* Use the `yaml` header to specify the subject line of the email
* Use `glue` to replace `{}` tags
* Preview the email in the RStudio viewer pane
* Send email (or saving as draft) using `gmailr`

Note: Right now, the only supported email back end is `gmailr` (see https://gmailr.r-lib.org/).
