Mail merge from R using markdown documents and gmail.

-   Parse markdown documents as the body of email
-   Use the `yaml` header to specify the subject line of the email
-   Use `glue` to replace `{}` tags
-   Preview the email in the RStudio viewer pane
-   Send email (or saving as draft) using `gmailr`

Note: Right now, the only supported email back end is `gmailr` (see
<https://gmailr.r-lib.org/>).

## Installation

Install the package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("mailmerge")
```

Install the dev version from <https://github.com/andrie/mailmerge>

``` r
remotes::install_github("andrie/mailmerge")
```

## Setup

At the moment only gmail is supported as the email back-end, using the
`gmailr` package (<https://github.com/r-lib/gmailr>).

Before you use `mail_merge()` itâ€™s important to authenticate against the
gmail service, and you should use `gmailr::gm_auth()` to do this.

## Example

Construct a data frame with the content you want to merge into your
email:

``` r
dat <-  data.frame(
  email      = c("friend@example.com", "foe@example.com"),
  first_name = c("friend", "foe"),
  thing      = c("something good", "something bad"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

Write the text of your email as a R markdown document. You can add the
subject line in the yaml header. Use `{}` braces inside the email to
refer to the data inside your data frame. Expressions inside these
braces will be encoded by the `glue::glue_data()` function (See
<https://glue.tidyverse.org/>).

``` r
msg <- '
---
subject: "**Hello, {first_name}**"
---

Hi, **{first_name}**

I am writing to tell you about **{thing}**.

{if (first_name == "friend") "Regards" else ""}


Me
'
```

Then you can use `mail_merge()` to embed the content of your data frame
into the email message. By default the email will be shown in a preview
window (in the RStudio viewer pane, if you use RStudio).

To send the message, use `send = "draft"` (to save in your gmail drafts
folder) or `send = "immediately"` to send the mail immediately.

``` r
library(mailmerge)
library(gmailr, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

if (interactive()) {
  # Note: you should always authenticate. The 'interactive()` condition only 
  # prevents execution on the CRAN servers
  gm_auth()
}
```

``` r
dat %>% 
  mail_merge(msg)
#> Sent preview to viewer
if (interactive()) {
  dat %>%
    mail_merge(msg) %>%
    print()
}
```
